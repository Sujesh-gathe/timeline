                    <h2>Robotics club</h2>
                    <p>
                        The club was started in 2015 with an aim to fuel the awareness in the field of Robotics in our College, 
                        and make a mark of RCOEM in this field too. The club consists of self-motivated students of almost all branches,
                        who want to learn, share and grow with others in the field of Robotics. There is only one requirement
                        for joining the club, i.e., INTEREST IN ROBOTICS.

                        Embedded systems are referred to as control systems tailored for specific applications. 
                        Nowadays, embedded systems are used in many different fields such as automotive, robotics, 
                        IoT, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, tele-communications, consumer electronics, 
                        biomedical equipment and instrumentation. Looking at its diversity of applications and 
                        potential for production of highly innovative products, embedded systems can be considered 
                        as the primary technology of the Present and Future.

                    <h2>SAE- India RCOEM Collegiate Club</h2>
                    <p>
                        With a motive to provide a common platform for Interdisciplinary
                        Technical Activities of the College, the technical club was launched in 2015.
                        The club aims to technically strengthen the students by integrating their skills
                        in the various fields of Engineering & technology, so as to cope up with the
                        highly competitive environment.

                    <h2>Drone club</h2>
                    <p>
                        Technically speaking, spaceborne drones could include cargo spacecraft, satellites and 
                        machines that leave Earth, although they aren't usually referred to as such. Perhaps the 
                        best example of a drone in space is the U.S. military's mysterious X-37B spacecraft, 
                        which has made multiple flights into orbit for hundreds of days at a time. Its mission is 
                        highly classified, leading to speculation about what it is doing.
